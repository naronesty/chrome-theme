# chrome-theme
I made a theme for chrome!

If you want to try it out, install the file and go to: 
chrome://extensions/ 
Enable developer mode then drag and drop file onto the screen to upload the theme (you can also click on "Load Unpacked").

There is a similar theme is the chrome web store called "scifi town sunset" which uses the same background image and has similar colors. However, the one in the webstore version has a very blurry version of the image and the colors it uses make it hard to read some of the screen text (like bookmarks).

In this theme, I created an updated version of the original that is easy to read and has a higher definition picture.

Also If you have any suggestions or anything is annoying or hard to read tell me.
